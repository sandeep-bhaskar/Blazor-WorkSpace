# Blazor JWT Authentication with Cookie Sample
This repository contains a sample Blazor application demonstrating how to implement JWT authentication with cookie-based authentication. It uses ASP.NET Core for the backend and Blazor for the frontend.

# Features
- User Authentication: Supports user login/logout functionality with JWT tokens stored in cookies.
- Authorization: Authorization to restrict access to certain components/pages.
- Cookie Authentication: Uses cookie-based authentication for maintaining user sessions.

# Configuration
Before running the application, you might need to configure the authentication settings in the appsettings.json file. Make sure to set the appropriate values for your authentication provider (e.g., JWT token settings, cookie settings).
